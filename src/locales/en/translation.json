Reading is a practical skill that can be practiced.In addition, it is enough for us to look at the page “diagonally” closely, which means that there, for example, we need addresses. In this situation, we read only a few words about the text, in order to understand the basic understanding of it - sound like they are reviewing a newspaper article. And, obviously, quite often we read a skin word, while we want to take away the maximum information (as an important document) - or satisfaction (as we read texts in English language or artistic tvir)."
